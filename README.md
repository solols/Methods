# Griefing-Methods

These are isnow's grieving methods, I used in the last 2 years. Read isnow_griefing.txt and papi_dump_methods.txt.

Those are not viruses, Windows Defender marks spigotrce as a reverse shell because it is a dump plugin that has a reverse shell payload to use.
Don't trust idiots like Serlink.
